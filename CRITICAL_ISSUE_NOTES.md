# CRITICAL ISSUE: JG-Rsync Blank Screen

## Current Status
- ✅ App launches from /Applications (double-clickable)
- ✅ 4 Electron processes running (main + helpers)
- ❌ **BLANK WHITE SCREEN** - No UI content displayed
- ❌ Renderer process not loading the React interface

## What I Tried (Failed)
1. Fixed index.html path from `../index.html` to `index.html`
2. Verified all files are in correct locations
3. Confirmed Electron is running properly

## Root Cause Analysis Needed
The issue is likely one of these:
1. **Renderer assets not loading** - CSS/JS bundles not found
2. **React app not mounting** - JavaScript errors preventing render
3. **File path issues** - Resources not accessible from production bundle
4. **Electron security policies** - CSP blocking local file access
5. **Build process issues** - Vite build not creating proper production assets

## Next Steps When Returning
1. **Debug the renderer process** - Check browser console for errors
2. **Verify all assets are accessible** - Check if CSS/JS files load
3. **Test with development mode** - Compare working dev vs broken production
4. **Check Electron security settings** - May need to adjust CSP or file access
5. **Examine the actual HTML being served** - Verify it contains the React app

## Files to Investigate
- `/Applications/JG-Rsync.app/Contents/Resources/index.html`
- `/Applications/JG-Rsync.app/Contents/Resources/renderer/` (all assets)
- Browser console errors in the Electron app
- Network tab to see what's failing to load

This is a critical issue that makes the app unusable despite being "launchable".
